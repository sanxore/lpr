\chapter*{Abstract}

Information Communication Technology (ICT) used on mobile systems has great potentials as a means of enhancing the quality of life and facilitating healthcare management. Smart Phones, tablet PCs and laptop computers, those portable and convenient devices are currently used to manage and monitor health. An elderly patient can measure her blood pressure and discuss her health with her doctor using mobile devices.
Itâ€™s impressive to have innovative new tools for managing health. What is more impressive is to have practical tools in parallel to maintain the security and privacy of sensitive health information when using mobile healthcare devices.
